        <ul> Ok, so you’ve learned the basics of DID, but what is it like to live with DID?  Here are only a few issues that we face on a regular basis.  Our system currently has 9 alters, 5 of which regularly front.  
            <li>Our appearance doesn’t match the body</li>
            <li>We constantly feel like we’re on autopilot</li>
            <li>We get easily frustrated</li>
            <li>We can never agree on what to eat</li>
            <li>We each have different hobbies, mannerisms, speech patterns, favorite movies, etc.</li>
            <li>We can’t agree on what to do for a career (we all have different goals)</li>
            <li>We have different opinions on how to handle life situations</li>
            <li>We all have trust issues</li>
            <li>We procrastinate on projects because we don’t know who will take the lead</li>
            <li>It is sometimes hard to figure out who is fronting/who we are</li>
            <li>We sometimes get embarrassed about other alter’s behavior, even though they did nothing wrong</li>
            <li>We have a hard time figuring out where we know you from</li>
            <li>We routinely question our DID diagnosis</li>
            <li>We don’t remember all our trauma</li>
            <li>We feel other alters emotions, sometimes at bad times</li>
            <li>We have trouble telling what is real</li>
        </ul>
