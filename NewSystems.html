    <P>Dear System,</P>
    <p>You are going through one of the worst times in your life right now, you are not alone--like, literally.  Please know that you are valuable and worthy of a good life.  It will take a while to sort out your new reality, don’t rush it.  

Your system has worked for years to ensure that you are unaware of their existence.  It will take time to build trust and you will know what you need to know when you are ready (safe/stable).  Remember that your alters are your teammates and there will be a lot of negotiations.  

It is not reasonable to try to figure this all out on your own.  Therapy doesn’t mean that you are weak or broken, it means that you need an outsider’s perspective to figure out your reality.  This is ok!  You are a survivor and you will survive this.  

We have a mantra that we’d like to share:  “You have to be stable before you’re able.”  Safety and stability are a priority right now, try to be patient and focus on self-care.  It is not selfish!  
</p>
