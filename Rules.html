       <p> Ok, so you’ve read this information and finally you have met someone with a dissociative disorder?  How can I interact with them without being an @ss?
       </p>

        <h1>Don’ts!</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>Do not be scared!  We are not violent.  One of the biggest tropes about dissociative disorders is that we are dangerous, this is simply not true.  We are more likely to be victims than perpetrators.</li>
        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fostering-freedom/202005/revictimization-how-can-keep-happening">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fostering-freedom/202005/revictimization-how-can-keep-happening</a>
        <li>Do not ask about our trauma!  This is a hard no, trauma experiences are not open for discussion.  Many of us have difficulties with trust.  Asking us to be so vulnerable would not be respectful.  It is natural to be curious, but if we want to share, it’ll be in our own time.</li>
        <li>Do not ask to speak to another alter!  You may have a favorite alter who you love to laugh and chat with, but remember that they share a body.  If a different alter reaches out to you, it is likely because they would like to get to know you too.  Don’t stamp out that attempt by asking them to leave so another alter can front.</li>
        <li>Don’t be surprised if we don’t remember things.  This is not a slam on you or something you should feel bad about.  There are a lot of memory issues within dissociative disorders.  Patience and forgiveness for memory issues will be greatly appreciated.</l1>
        <li>Don’t treat us like a circus freak!  Interest is great if you want to be a friend/acquaintance, but we are not a magical creature, laboratory animal, or fantasy story.  We are human.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Dos!</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>Do realize that alters consider themselves different people.  Even though we share a common face, we do have conflicting opinions, behaviors, and beliefs.  Our reality is different from yours.</li>
        <li>Do ask questions.  If we have told you that we have a dissociative disorder you may ask questions (non-trauma related).  Remember this was caused by childhood trauma, so we do not always pick up on social queues.  If we have shared this information we have opened up the subject and accept you to have respectful questions.  Questions mean you are interested/care.</li>
        <li>Do read up on our diagnosis.  It takes seconds and it will mean a lot that you are interested.</li>
        </ul>    
        
        <p><em>
        ***Remember that all systems are different.  Other systems may have different opinions.  When in doubt ask the system their personal do’s and don'ts.  It is respectful and appreciated.
