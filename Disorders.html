    <h1>    What are dissociative disorders?</h1>
    <p>    “Dissociative disorders are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. People with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and cause problems with functioning in everyday life.
    </p> <p>    
    <p>    Dissociative disorders usually develop as a reaction to trauma and help keep difficult memories at bay. Symptoms — ranging from amnesia to alternate identities — depend in part on the type of dissociative disorder you have. Times of stress can temporarily worsen symptoms, making them more obvious.
        Treatment for dissociative disorders may include talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medication. Although treating dissociative disorders can be difficult, many people learn new ways of coping and lead healthy, productive lives.”<br>
        <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215">--Mayo Clinic</a></p>
    <p>    
        So, quick translation: dissociative disorders evolve due to childhood trauma.  The dissociation allows them to continue life while masking their prior trauma.  While this is successful for survival, it causes difficulty in everyday life, especially with memory and relationships.
    </p>    <h1>How common is dissociative identity disorder (DID)?</h1>
    <p>        Most current studies place the prevalence of dissociative identity disorder (DID) between 0.1% to 2%, though a few give estimations as high as 3-5%.<br>
        <a href="https://did-research.org/did/basics/prevalence">--DID Research</a>
    </p>    
    <p>    The United States population is approximately 333,618,192 people.  This means that between 333,618-6,672,363 people in the US alone suffer from dissociative disorders.  Let’s make it a little more personal...let's say you live in New York City which has a population of 8,804,190. This means that between 8,804-176,083 people in New York City struggle with a dissociative disorder.  Even though it is a very small percentage of the population, it translates to a large number of people. Remember, this is only 1 of the dissociative disorders.</p>
        <h1>Why is this so popular right now?</h1>
    <p>    In 2020 popular YouTuber, Anthony Padilla, performed an interview with several dissociative identity disorder (DID) systems, bringing DID out of the shadows.  Unfortunately, internet drama followed which brought a negative light onto DID.  Since then, DID persons have opened up online to correct mis-information and show a more accurate depiction of the disorder.</p>
    <h1>    What are the common types of dissociative disorders?</h1><br>
    
    <ul>So glad you asked!  
        <li>Dissociative identity disorder</li>
        <li>Dissociative amnesia</li>
        <li>Depersonalization/derealization disorder</li>
        <li>Other specified dissociative disorder</li>
        <li>Unspecified dissociative disorder</li>
    </ul>     
    <p>    The two most notable dissociative disorders are dissociative identity disorder (DID) and otherwise specified dissociative disorders (OSDD).  Each of these disorders have very specific criteria for diagnosis.  OSDD is similar to DID, but lacks all criteria for diagnosis.  OSDD is divided into 4 different types.</p>
    <h1>    What is required for a DID diagnosis?</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.</li>
         
        <li> Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.</li>
         
        <li> The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
         
        <li> The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.</li>
         
        <li> The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication or other medical condition, eg, complex partial seizures) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)</li>
    </ol>    
        <a href="https://did-research.org/did/basics/dsm-5/">https://did-research.org/did/basics/dsm-5/</a>
        
    <p><h1>    Good God man, that’s a lot of words.  Let’s get to the point.</h1></p>
        <ol><li>Two or more distinct states of identity (at least one alter)</li>
        <li>Can’t remember daily life.</li>
        <li>Causes distress and difficulty in functioning</li>
        <li>Distress is not related to accepted cultural/religious practices</li>
        <li>Distress is not related to substances or other medical conditions.</li>
        </ol>
        <em>If you do not have DID this may be unfathomable, but it is our reality.  <br>
        ***Side note, this is no longer referred to as multiple personality disorder since 1994 as it is not a personality disorder, but a dissociative disorder.</em>
<p>        
        <h1>What is required for an OSDD diagnosis?</h1>
        </p>
       <p> "This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to specify reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative disorder. This is done by recording "other specified dissociative disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "dissociative trance"). Example presentations that can be specified using the "other specified" designation include the following: "1. Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms. This category includes identity disturbance associated with less than marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia. 2. Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion: Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged changes in, or conscious questions of, their identity. 3. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events: This category is for acute, transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few hours or days. These conditions are characterized by constriction of consciousness; depersonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis). 4. Dissociative trance: This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that manifest as profound unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli. May be accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors of which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as transient paralysis or loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice. " </p>

        <p><h1>Too many words, where are the cliff-notes?</h1>
        </p>
        <p>Ok, so OSDD is a dissociative disorder like DID but doesn’t meet all the criteria.  Numbers after the OSDD (e.g. OSDD-1) identify the dominant symptom making their life difficult.</p>
        
        OSDD-1:  chronic dissociative symptoms, focusing on identity, with no amnesia<br>
        OSDD-2:  identity issues caused by prolonged brainwashing<br>
        OSDD-3:  stress-induced dissociation, includes depersonalization, derealization, with possible somatic symptoms</br>
        OSDD-4: dissociative trance, unaware of surroundings<br>
        
        <em>***Please note that we have DID, not OSDD.  Apologies to OSDD systems if this is oversimplified.  Please email with suggested improvements.</em>
